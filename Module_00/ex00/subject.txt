Java is a strictly typed programming language. Fundamental data types (boolean, character,
integer, floating point number) are represented in Java by eight primitive types: boolean,
char, byte, short, int, long, float, double.

Work with integer type.
	• Calculate the sum of digits of a six-digit int number (the number value is set directly
	in the code by explicitly initializating the number variable).

Example of the program operation for number 479598:
	$ java Program
